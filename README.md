# Yandex.Auto internship problem


This is an Android Studio project, based on the task: https://github.com/justmnemonic/yandex-auto-task/

- To find a repository enter its **title** / **owner's name** into the field and click the `search` button.

- Once you've clicked on the found repo, it will open your browser with the clicked repository in it.

- Visited repositories are shown on the other screen, which you can navigate by clicking the `history` button.

- `Swipe left` on the history screen will delete the repository from the storage.

- `Swipe right` on the history will make the repository favourite (**the second swipe will cancel it**).

- The `star` button on the history screen toggles the view mode (all repos / favourite only)
