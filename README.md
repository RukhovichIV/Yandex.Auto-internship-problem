# Yandex.Auto internship problem


This is android studio project, based on the task: https://github.com/justmnemonic/yandex-auto-task/

To find a repository enter its **title** / **owner's name** into the field and click the `search` button.

Once you clicked on the found button, it will open your browser with the clicked repository in it.

Visited repositories are shown on the other screen, which you can navigate by clicking the `history` button.

Swipe left on the history screen will delete the repository from the storage.

Swipe right on the history will make the repository favourite (the second swipe will cancel it).

The `star` button on the history screen toggles the view mode (all repos / favourite only)
